# NOTE ON UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR

Some examples in this project intentionally demonstrate
undefined behavior in C (e.g., missing null terminators).

These examples may appear to work on one system but are
not valid according to the C standard.

They are included strictly for learning and examination
preparation purposes.
